For more information, see About GitHub's IP addresses.If you're having connectivity problems on your company or organization's network, check with your network administrator to find out if the network has rules in place to block certain traffic.

    "content": "Learn about the tools you can use to work with repositories hosted on GitHub.GitHub is a web-based app that lets you host files in repositories, collaborate on work, and track changes to files over time. Version tracking on GitHub is powered by the open source software Git. Whenever you update a repository on GitHub, Git tracks the changes you make.There are many ways to work with GitHub, and you can choose a method that suits your level of experience, personal preferences, and the repositories you work with. For example, you can choose whether you want to work in the browser or from your desktop, how you want to use Git, and what capabilities you need from your editor and other software. You may choose to work with different repositories in different ways.If you're new to GitHub, a good way to start contributing is to make changes in the browser on GitHub.com. As you become more familiar with GitHub and start contributing larger changes, you may want to start working with other tools. This article explains how to progress through these stages and helps you choose the best tool for your requirements at each stage. To quickly compare all the tools available for working with GitHub, see Comparison of tools for connecting to GitHub.In the user interface on GitHub.com, you can perform the whole \"GitHub flow\" for contributing to a repository, including creating a branch or fork, editing and previewing files, committing your changes, and creating a pull request. You can also upload files from your computer or download them from the repository. For more information, see GitHub flow.Working directly on GitHub.com is often the quickest way to contribute to a repository, for the following reasons.For a tutorial to help you get started with making changes in the browser, see Hello World.Working directly on GitHub.com is best for small, simple changes, often targeting a single file in a repository. If you want to work in the browser but need to make more complex changes, such as moving content between files, you can choose from the following tools to open a repository in a dedicated editor.Alternatively, you can connect to GitHub from your desktop, and work with a local copy of the repository.To work with a repository from your desktop, you'll need to download (or \"clone\") a copy of the repository to your computer, then push any changes you make to GitHub. Working from your desktop can have several advantages over working in the browser.If you haven't worked with a GitHub repository from your desktop before, you'll need to authenticate to GitHub from your computer, so you can access the repositories you need. You may also need to set up your working environment with the tools you need to contribute, such as Git, an editor, and dependencies for a project. For these reasons, it can take longer to get started if you want to work from your desktop, compared to working in the browser.There are several tools you can use to connect to GitHub from your desktop. These tools allow you to authenticate to GitHub, clone a repository, track your changes, and push the changes to GitHub.The following table provides a comparison between the tools you can use to work with repositories on GitHub, both in your browser and from your desktop.You can perform the whole GitHub flow with any of the tools described here. Each tool includes access not only to Git commands for tracking the changes you've made, but also to GitHub-specific features, so you can create a pull request with your proposed changes from wherever you're working.For more information about how to authenticate to GitHub with each of these tools, see About authentication to GitHub.All GitHub docs are open source.

    "content": "Follow GitHub flow to collaborate on projects.GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow. The GitHub flow is useful for everyone, not just developers. For example, here at GitHub, we use GitHub flow for our site policy, documentation, and roadmap.To follow GitHub flow, you will need a GitHub account and a repository. For information on how to create an account, see Creating an account on GitHub. For information on how to create a repository, see Quickstart for repositories. For information on how to find an existing repository to contribute to, see Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub.Tip\nYou can complete all steps of GitHub flow through the GitHub web interface, command line and GitHub CLI, or GitHub Desktop. For more information about the tools you can use to connect to GitHub, see Connecting to GitHub.Create a branch in your repository. A short, descriptive branch name enables your collaborators to see ongoing work at a glance. For example, increase-test-timeout or add-code-of-conduct. For more information, see Creating and deleting branches within your repository.By creating a branch, you create a space to work without affecting the default branch. Additionally, you give collaborators a chance to review your work.On your branch, make any desired changes to the repository. For more information, see Creating new files, Editing files, Renaming a file, Moving a file to a new location, or Deleting files in a repository.Your branch is a safe place to make changes. If you make a mistake, you can revert your changes or push additional changes to fix the mistake. Your changes will not end up on the default branch until you merge your branch.Commit and push your changes to your branch. Give each commit a descriptive message to help you and future contributors understand what changes the commit contains. For example, fix typo or increase rate limit.Ideally, each commit contains an isolated, complete change. This makes it easy to revert your changes if you decide to take a different approach. For example, if you want to rename a variable and add some tests, put the variable rename in one commit and the tests in another commit. Later, if you want to keep the tests but revert the variable rename, you can revert the specific commit that contained the variable rename. If you put the variable rename and tests in the same commit or spread the variable rename across multiple commits, you would spend more effort reverting your changes.By committing and pushing your changes, you back up your work to remote storage. This means that you can access your work from any device. It also means that your collaborators can see your work, answer questions, and make suggestions or contributions.Continue to make, commit, and push changes to your branch until you are ready to ask for feedback.Tip\nMake a separate branch for each set of unrelated changes. This makes it easier for reviewers to give feedback. It also makes it easier for you and future collaborators to understand the changes and to revert or build on them. Additionally, if there is a delay in one set of changes, your other changes aren't also delayed.Create a pull request to ask collaborators for feedback on your changes. Pull request review is so valuable that some repositories require an approving review before pull requests can be merged. If you want early feedback or advice before you complete your changes, you can mark your pull request as a draft. For more information, see Creating a pull request.When you create a pull request, include a summary of the changes and what problem they solve. You can include images, links, and tables to help convey this information. If your pull request addresses an issue, link the issue so that issue stakeholders are aware of the pull request and vice versa. If you link with a keyword, the issue will close automatically when the pull request merges. For more information, see Basic writing and formatting syntax and Linking a pull request to an issue.In addition to filling out the body of the pull request, you can add comments to specific lines of the pull request to explicitly point something out to the reviewers.Your repository may be configured to automatically request a review from specific teams or users when a pull request is created. You can also manually @mention or request a review from specific people or teams.If your repository has checks configured to run on pull requests, you will see any checks that failed on your pull request. This helps you catch errors before merging your branch. For more information, see About status checks.Reviewers should leave questions, comments, and suggestions. Reviewers can comment on the whole pull request or add comments to specific lines or files. You and reviewers can insert images or code suggestions to clarify comments. For more information, see Reviewing changes in pull requests.You can continue to commit and push changes in response to the reviews. Your pull request will update automatically.Once your pull request is approved, merge your pull request. This will automatically merge your branch so that your changes appear on the default branch. GitHub retains the history of comments and commits in the pull request to help future contributors understand your changes. For more information, see Merging a pull request.GitHub will tell you if your pull request has conflicts that must be resolved before merging. For more information, see Addressing merge conflicts.Branch protection settings may block merging if your pull request does not meet certain requirements. For example, you need a certain number of approving reviews or an approving review from a specific team. For more information, see About protected branches.After you merge your pull request, delete your branch. This indicates that the work on the branch is complete and prevents you or others from accidentally using old branches. For more information, see Deleting and restoring branches in a pull request.Don't worry about losing information. Your pull request and commit history will not be deleted. You can always restore your deleted branch or revert your pull request if needed.All GitHub docs are open source. See something that's wrong or unclear? Submit a pull request.Learn how to contribute"

For more information, see About your profile and Viewing contributions on your profile.To best use GitHub, you'll need to set up Git. Git is responsible for everything GitHub-related that happens locally on your computer. To effectively collaborate on GitHub, you'll write in issues and pull requests using GitHub Flavored Markdown.GitHub's collaborative approach to development depends on publishing commits from your local repository to GitHub for other people to view, fetch, and update using Git. For more information about Git, see the Git Handbook guide. For more information about how Git is used on GitHub, see GitHub flow.If you plan to use Git locally on your computer, whether through the command line, an IDE or text editor, you will need to install and set up Git. For more information, see Set up Git.If you prefer to use a visual interface, you can download and use GitHub Desktop. GitHub Desktop comes packaged with Git, so there is no need to install Git separately. For more information, see Getting started with GitHub Desktop.Once you install Git, you can connect to GitHub repositories from your local computer, whether your own repository or another user's fork. When you connect to a repository on GitHub.com from Git, you'll need to authenticate with GitHub using either HTTPS or SSH. For more information, see About remote repositories.Everyone has their own unique workflow for interacting with GitHub; the interfaces and methods you use depend on your preference and what works best for your needs.For more information about the different approaches for interacting with GitHub, and a comparison of the tools you can use, see Connecting to GitHub.To make your communication clear and organized in issues and pull requests, you can use GitHub Flavored Markdown for formatting, which combines an easy-to-read, easy-to-write syntax with some custom functionality. For more information, see About writing and formatting on GitHub.You can learn GitHub Flavored Markdown with the Communicate using Markdown course on GitHub Skills.Our integrated search allows you to find what you are looking for among the many repositories, users and lines of code on GitHub. You can search globally across all of GitHub or limit your search to a particular repository or organization. For more information about the types of searches you can do on GitHub, see About searching on GitHub.Our search syntax allows you to construct queries using qualifiers to specify what you want to search for. For more information on the search syntax to use in search, see Searching on GitHub.With GitHub, you can create, edit, move and delete files in your repository or any repository you have write access to. You can also track the history of changes in a file line by line. For more information, see Managing files.Any number of people can work together in repositories across GitHub. You can configure settings, create projects, and manage your notifications to encourage effective collaboration.A repository is like a folder for your project. You can have any number of public and private repositories in your personal account. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets, as well as the revision history for all files in the repository. For more information, see About repositories.When you create a new repository, you should initialize the repository with a README file to let people know about your project. For more information, see Creating a new repository.You can clone an existing repository from GitHub to your local computer, making it easier to add or remove files, fix merge conflicts, or make complex commits. Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that GitHub has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project. For more information, see Cloning a repository.A fork is a copy of a repository that you manage, where any changes you make will not affect the original repository unless you submit a pull request to the project owner. Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. For more information, see Working with forks.If you have existing projects you'd like to move over to GitHub you can import projects using the GitHub Importer, the command line, or external migration tools. For more information, see Importing source code.You can collaborate on your project with others using your repository's issues, pull requests, and projects. You can invite other people to your repository as collaborators from the Collaborators tab in the repository settings. For more information, see Inviting collaborators to a personal repository.You are the owner of any repository you create in your personal account and have full control of the repository. Collaborators have write access to your repository, limiting what they have permission to do. For more information, see Permission levels for a personal account repository.As the owner of a repository you can configure several settings, including the repository's visibility, topics, and social media preview.

If you're writing a software project, grouping all the related files in a new repository makes it easier to maintain and manage the codebase over time.In the upper-right corner of any page, select , then click New repository.In the \"Repository name\" box, type a name for your project. For example, type \"my-first-project.\"In the \"Description\" box, type a short description. For example, type \"This is my first project on GitHub.\"Select whether your repository will be Public or Private. Select \"Public\" if you want others to be able to see your project.Select Add a README file. You will edit this file in a later step.Click Create repository.So far, you should only see one file listed in the repository, the README.md file you created when you initialized the repository. Now, we'll upload some of your own files.Your repository's README file is typically the first item someone will see when visiting your repository. It usually contains information on what your project is about and why your project is useful.As we learned in the Hello World tutorial, the README file (README.md) is written in Markdown syntax. Markdown is an easy-to-read, easy-to-write language for formatting plain text.In this step, we'll edit your project's README.md using Markdown so that it includes some basic information about your project.From the list of files, click README.md to view the file.In the upper right corner of the file view, click  to open the file editor.Delete the existing text apart from #, then type a proper title for your project.Next, add some information about your project, such as a description of the project's purpose or its main features.Note\nIf you're not sure what to write, take a look at other repositories on GitHub to see how other people describe their projects.To apply more sophisticated formatting, such as adding images, links, and footnotes, see Basic writing and formatting syntax.Above the new content, click Preview.Take a look at how the file will render once we save our changes, then toggle back to \"Edit\".Continue to edit and preview the text until you're happy with the content of your README.In the top right, click Commit changes.In the dialog box that opens, a commit message has been pre-filled for you (\"Update README.md\") and, by default, the option to \"Commit directly to the main branch\" has been selected. Leave these options as they are and go ahead and click Commit changes.You have now created a new repository, uploaded some files to it, and added a project README.If you set your repository visibility to \"Public,\" the repository will be displayed on your personal profile and you can share the URL of your repository with others.As you add, edit or delete files directly in the browser on GitHub, GitHub will track these changes (\"commits\"), so you can start to manage your project's history and evolution.When making changes, remember that you can create a new branch from the main branch of your repository, so that you can experiment without affecting the main copy of files. Then, when you're happy with a set of a changes, open a pull request to merge the changes into your main branch. For a reminder of how to do this, see Hello World.Most people want to keep working on their files locally (i.e. on their own computer), and then continually sync these locally-made changes with this \"remote\" (in the cloud) repository on GitHub. There are plenty of tools that let you do this, such as GitHub Desktop.

    "content": "Follow this Hello World exercise to learn GitHub's pull request workflow.This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests. You'll create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub's pull request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.In this quickstart guide, you will:You must have a GitHub account. For more information, see Creating an account on GitHub.You don't need to know how to code, use the command line, or install Git (the version control software that GitHub is built on).The first thing we'll do is create a repository. You can think of a repository as a folder that contains related items, such as files, images, videos, or even other folders. A repository usually groups together items that belong to the same \"project\" or thing you're working on.Often, repositories include a README file, a file with information about your project. README files are written in Markdown, which is an easy-to-read, easy-to-write language for formatting plain text. We'll learn more about Markdown in the next tutorial, Setting up your profile.GitHub lets you add a README file at the same time you create your new repository. GitHub also offers other common options such as a license file, but you do not have to select any of them now.Your hello-world repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.In the upper-right corner of any page, select , then click New repository.In the \"Repository name\" box, type hello-world.In the \"Description\" box, type a short description. For example, type \"This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.\"Select whether your repository will be Public or Private.Select Add a README file.Click Create repository.Branching lets you have different versions of a repository at one time.By default, your repository has one branch named main that is considered to be the definitive branch. You can create additional branches off of main in your repository.Branching is helpful when you want to add new features to a project without changing the main source of code. The work done on different branches will not show up on the main branch until you merge it, which we will cover later in this guide. You can use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to main.When you create a branch off the main branch, you're making a copy, or snapshot, of main as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the main branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.This diagram shows:Click the Code tab of your hello-world repository.Above the file list, click the dropdown menu that says main.Type a branch name, readme-edits, into the text box.Click Create branch: readme-edits from main.Now you have two branches, main and readme-edits. Right now, they look exactly the same. Next you'll add changes to the new readme-edits branch.When you created a new branch in the previous step, GitHub brought you to the code page for your new readme-edits branch, which is a copy of main.You can make and save changes to the files in your repository. On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes so that other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.These changes will be made only to the README file on your readme-edits branch, so now this branch contains content that's different from main.Now that you have changes in a branch off of main, you can open a pull request.Pull requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you're proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in different colors.As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.In this step, you'll open a pull request in your own repository and then merge it yourself. It's a great way to practice the GitHub flow before working on larger projects.Click the Pull requests tab of your hello-world repository.Click New pull request.In the Example Comparisons box, select the branch you made, readme-edits, to compare with main (the original).Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make sure they're what you want to submit.Click Create pull request.Give your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes. You can include emojis and drag and drop images and gifs.Click Create pull request.When you start collaborating with others, this is the time you'd ask for their review. This allows your collaborators to comment on, or propose changes to, your pull request before you merge the changes into the main branch.We won't cover reviewing pull requests in this tutorial, but if you're interested in learning more, see About pull request reviews. Alternatively, try the GitHub Skills \"Reviewing pull requests\" course.In this final step, you will merge your readme-edits branch into the main branch. After you merge your pull request, the changes on your readme-edits branch will be incorporated into main.Sometimes, a pull request may introduce changes to code that conflict with the existing code on main. If there are any conflicts, GitHub will alert you about the conflicting code and prevent merging until the conflicts are resolved. You can make a commit that resolves the conflicts or use comments in the pull request to discuss the conflicts with your team members.In this walk-through, you should not have any conflicts, so you are ready to merge your branch into the main branch.By completing this tutorial, you've learned to create a project and make a pull request on GitHub.As part of that, we've learned how to:All GitHub docs are open source.

Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead. \nGitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.  GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security.Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the documentation.GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers.

The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.If you're on the Free plan, you can upgrade to Pro through your Copilot settings page or directly on the Copilot marketing page.GitHub Copilot Free users are limited to 2000 completions and 50 chat requests (including Copilot Edits).GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:User Engagement Data: This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics. Prompts: These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions. Suggestions: These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts. Feedback Data: This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models. How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendationsTroubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-datenessEnhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operationalThese practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement (DPA), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers. GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:Billing and account managementTo comply with and resolve legal obligations For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of serviceTo generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentivesTo produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the GitHub Privacy Statement.If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows: Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:Prompts and Suggestions: Not retainedUser Engagement Data: Kept for two years.Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.All other GitHub Copilot access and use:Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions. Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a Data Protection Agreement that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals. These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the GitHub Privacy Statement.\nThe primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see \"Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com\". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations. With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a code referencing feature as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or                        idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also                        synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that                        either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including hardcoded credentials, SQL injections, and path injections. Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective                        risk tolerances.As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment for more details.We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with                        disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our feedback forum.GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid                        synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter                        system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found here.Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead. \nGitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.  GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise.

The types of personal data processed may include:User Engagement Data: This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics. Prompts: These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions. Suggestions: These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts. Feedback Data: This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models. How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendationsTroubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-datenessEnhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operationalThese practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement (DPA), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers. GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:Billing and account managementTo comply with and resolve legal obligations For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of serviceTo generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentivesTo produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the GitHub Privacy Statement.If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows: Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:Prompts and Suggestions: Not retainedUser Engagement Data: Kept for two years.Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.All other GitHub Copilot access and use:Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions. Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a Data Protection Agreement that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals. These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the GitHub Privacy Statement.\nThe primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see \"Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com\". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations. With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a code referencing feature as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion.

It is a drop-in replacement for the SafetyNet reCAPTCHA API. You will need to configure a site key and a secret key from your hCaptcha account in order to use it.Note: replace x.y.z with one from Release (e.g. 1.0.0).The current repository comes with an example Android application demonstrating 3 different hCaptcha usage patterns.See the code example below along with the possible customization to enable human verification in your Android application.There are multiple ways to run a hCaptcha human verification. See the below snippet for the overall flow.To remove a specific listener you may use HCaptcha.removeOn[Success|Failure|Open]Listener(listener).To remove all listeners you may use HCaptcha.removeAllListener().Note ⚠️: For any sitekey that can show visual challenges, HCaptcha.getClient(Activity) must be called with FragmentActivity instance.Activity is allowed only when hideDialog=true and sitekey setting is Passive (Enterprise feature).To fetch token data from activity in @Composable Class:We cache the fragment instance inside the SDK to speed up the next HCaptcha.verifyWithHCaptcha calls.Once you are done with verification, you can call HCaptcha.reset() to release all allocated resources including the strong reference to com.hcaptcha.sdk.HCaptchaDialogFragment.Note: If you do not call .reset() you will likely see a warning from tools like LeakCanary.The following list contains configuration properties to allows customization of the hCaptcha verification flow.In some scenarios in which the human verification process cannot be completed.\nYou can add logic to gracefully handle the errors.The following is a list of possible error codes:You can indicate an automatic verification retry by setting the lambda config HCaptchaConfig.retryPredicate.One must be careful to not introduce infinite retries and thus blocking the user from error recovering.Example below will automatically retry in case of CHALLENGE_CLOSED error:Lambda may implicitly capture variables from its surrounding context.\nFor a lambda to be serializable, all the captured variables must be serializable as well.\nFailing to meet this requirement can result in runtime errors when attempting to deserialize the lambda.The retryPredicate is part of HCaptchaConfig that may get persist during application lifecycle.\nSo pay attention to this aspect and make sure that retryPredicate is serializable to avoid\nandroid.os.BadParcelableException in run-time.Useful error messages are often rendered on the hCaptcha checkbox. For example, if the sitekey within your config is invalid, you'll see a message there. To quickly debug your local instance using this tool, set .size(HCaptchaSize.NORMAL)HCaptchaConfigBuilder.diagnosticLog(true) can help to get more detailed logs.After retrieving a token, you should pass it to your backend in order to verify the validity of the token by doing a server side check using the hCaptcha secret linked to your sitekey.Can I get a token in a non-UI thread?No: the SDK depends on WebView, which is a UI component and cannot be instantiated in a non-UI thread.However, the SDK provides a completely silent (invisible to the end-user) mechanism with hideDialog=true config + \"passive\" site key (this is an Enterprise feature). But note that the token request still has to be called from the UI thread.How can I prevent the hCaptcha verification from being canceled when the back button is pressed?It is possible by specifying HCaptchaConfig.retryPredicate as shown in the following code snippet:HCaptcha constantly failing with IllegalStateException \"Visual Challenge verification require FragmentActivity\", how to fix it?SDK expect to be initialized with FragmentActivity instance in regular scenario.In case if you use passive siteKey make sure that you called hideDialog(true) on HCaptchaCconfig.builder()If you plan to contribute to the repo, please see MAINTAINERS.md for detailed build, test, and release instructions.\n        Android SDK for hCaptcha"

This is used purely for analytics breakdowns on your sitekey, and is treated as untrusted data; it has no security implications.This is the equivalent of the SDK argument host provided in our native SDKs. (Examples: iOS, Android)Note that we would always recommend using our native SDKs when your environment permits this. Integrating our native SDKs is simpler and more efficient than managing your own webview, and enables better performance in many cases.If you are already managing your own webview, then your existing flow will almost always look like this:To switch to hCaptcha, you generally only need to: swap out the JS tag in your HTML file (step 1), change the execute call (step 2), and call the hCaptcha API to verify the token (step 4).This is typically a very quick process, so if you have any questions please reach out to Support and we will be happy to help."

For example, clicking Submit on a form to trigger hCaptcha token generation can use the \"invisible\" mode by setting this option as described below.\"Passive\" means no visible challenge is ever shown, i.e. purely passive mechanisms for humanity verification are used. This is set via the sitekey's difficulty level.Enterprise users can combine \"Invisible\" (no checkbox) configuration with \"Passive\" difficulty to avoid any user interruption.

À l'aide des paramètres de requête, vous pouvez spécifier une fonction de rappel personnalisée, différer le rendu ou forcer une localisation spécifique.Les paramètres de requête sont définis sous forme de paires key=value suivant un ? après le nom du script. Par exemple, pour rendre explicitement les captchas en français, votre balise de script devrait ressembler à ceci :Plusieurs paramètres de requête sont séparés par\u0026 .Étant donné que hCaptcha ne déclenche pas le chargement tant que la configuration n'est pas terminée, il n'est pas nécessaire d'attendre via une méthode .ready() . Déclenchez simplement tout changement de code ou d'état dont vous avez besoin via le chargement, et lorsqu'il se déclenchera, hCaptcha sera déjà prêt pour une interaction programmatique ultérieure.La deuxième façon de configurer hCaptcha consiste à définir des attributs personnalisés sur le conteneur hCaptcha \u003cdiv\u003e . Vous devez déjà le faire avec data-sitekey , mais il existe une poignée d'autres attributs facultatifs qui permettent plus de personnalisation.Outre le data-sitekey requis, vous pouvez ajouter autant ou aussi peu d'attributs de configuration que vous le souhaitez.Tous ces attributs peuvent également être utilisés comme paramètres lors du rendu explicite avec hcaptcha.render() comme décrit ci-dessous. Le nom du paramètre est l'attribut dans le tableau ci-dessus, mais sans le préfixe des données.

Cependant, vous pouvez également différer le rendu en spécifiant une fonction de rappel onload personnalisée dans laquelle vous restituez vous-même le widget.Pour spécifier une fonction de rappel onload personnalisée, vous devez transmettre le nom de la fonction en tant que paramètre de requête « onload » dans la balise javascript hCaptcha.

    "content": "There are two ways to configure hCaptcha. The first is to pass query parameters when loading the hCaptcha javascript resource. Using query params, you can specify a custom callback function, defer rendering, or force a specific localization.Query params are set as key=value pairs following a ? after the script name. For example, to explicitly render captchas in French, your script tag should look like this:Multiple query params are separated by \u0026.Because hCaptcha does not fire the onload until setup is complete, it is not necessary to wait via a .ready() method. Simply trigger any code or state change you need via the onload, and when it fires hCaptcha will already be ready for further programmatic interaction.The second way to configure hCaptcha is to set custom attributes on the hCaptcha container \u003cdiv\u003e. You're already required to do this with data-sitekey, but there are a handful of other optional attributes that enable more customization.Besides the required data-sitekey, you can add as many or as few configuration attributes as you want.All of these attributes can also be used as parameters when explicitly rendering with hcaptcha.render() as described below. The parameter name is the Attribute in the table above, but without the data prefix. For example, data-tabindex is tabindex when passed into .render().The hCaptcha API exposes the hcaptcha object that has methods you may find useful in customizing hCaptcha behavior.Renders the hCaptcha widget inside the container DOM element. Returns a unique widgetID for the widget.Resets the hCaptcha widget with widgetID.Gets the response for the hCaptcha widget with widgetID.Gets the response ID for the hCaptcha widget with widgetID.Triggers the hCaptcha workflow programmatically. Generally used in invisible mode where the target container is a div rather than a button.Optionally, you can pass { async: true } to hcaptcha.execute() in order to get a promise back.The following error codes are passed as argument to the error-callback function or as rejection data to the asynchronous execute.Please note that asynchronous .execute() calls can reject the promise with extra error codes (e.g. challenge-closed) which are not passed to the error-callback as there are other callbacks (e.g. close-callback) defined for these scenarios.In the table below, each error code is listed, along with details to interpret it and any action suggested. If you are using hCaptcha in a fully programmatic pattern (\"invisible\" mode, i.e. no checkbox, with .execute() called by your functions and errors rendered in your code rather than relying on ours) then please ensure your code follows the expected behavior by described by the Action when interpreting an error.In the default implementation, hCaptcha widgets will be automatically rendered and inserted into your webpage. However, you can also defer rendering by specifying a custom onload callback function in which you render the widget yourself.To specify a custom onload callback function, you must pass the function name as an onload query parameter in the hCaptcha javascript tag. In addition, you must set the render query parameter to explicit. Your hCaptcha script tag should look like this (replace yourFunction with the name of your function):Your custom callback function must be defined before the hCaptcha script loads. You can then call hcaptcha.render with the container ID and your sitekey to explicitly render the widget.api.js query parameters like recaptchacompat=off are parsed on Dom.ready. Do not call hcaptcha.render() right away if you are using render=explicit to avoid racing SDK setup. Instead, call render via the function you define in api.js?onload=yourFunc to ensure the SDK is fully initialized.You can apply a dark theme to the hCaptcha widget by setting the data-theme attribute of the hCaptcha container to dark.There's also a compact option to give the widget a smaller footprint. Set the data-size attribute of the hCaptcha container to compact."

We offer a drop-in replacement, so this often takes only a few minutes.In general, client-side interactions are about the same as a traditional captcha: 3-10 seconds depending on the difficulty mode.This depends on computed confidence in the visitor's humanity, the site difficulty setting, and other security factors. When a user fails a captcha, a new one will also be presented to the user.The hCaptcha service works on every major desktop and mobile browser, as well as desktop and mobile apps. The last two major versions of each browser are officially supported. The following is a non-exclusive list of browsers fully supported by hCaptcha:Internet Explorer 10 is currently supported on a best-effort basis. IE8 and IE9 are no longer supported. Best-effort and unsupported browser versions together constitute less than 0.10% of all human traffic on the internet in 2023.End of life for IE8 and IE9 Tier 1 support (proactive testing) occurred on January 1, 2020. End of life for IE10 Tier 1 support occurred on August 1, 2020. Extensions are available for enterprise users. Please contact us if you require extended support.The hCaptcha SDK relies on Content Security Policy Level 2 support, which was introduced about 10 years ago. The following browser version minimums thus apply:Extended support for older browsers and rare embedded browser engines is available to hCaptcha Enterprise customers upon request. Please contact us for more information on this topic.Please note: like 30% of the internet, hCaptcha uses Let's Encrypt as its primary TLS certificates. This means that the OS root certificate store must trust ISRG Root X1, as is the case for every OS, browser, and library released in the last decade or so:Browsers generally trust the same root certificates as the operating system aside from Firefox, which has its own root store. Chrome also uses its own root store as of Chrome 105.Support for deprecated legacy operating systems and browsers is available to hCaptcha Enterprise customers via our First-Party feature, enabling you to serve hCaptcha using your own certificates. Please contact hCaptcha Support for more information if you require this feature.Only modern browsers are supported for the hCaptcha administration dashboard, the interface used to configure hCaptcha for your site and see statistics. The last two major versions of each browser are officially supported:Recent versions of Apple Safari are expected to work, but Firefox and Chrome are the recommended browsers.hCaptcha also stops bots and spam, but gives you more control over the difficulty level you need for your site and does a better job of protecting your users' privacy.hCaptcha has 100% of the features of reCAPTCHA V2 and is API-compatible with reCAPTCHA V2. Please see our implementation docs for more information.hCaptcha Enterprise has all of the features of reCAPTCHA V2 + V3, and goes much further with sophisticated custom threat models, detailed bot scores, and more, including unique privacy technology that makes compliance with privacy rules like GDPR, LGPD, CCPA, and more straightforward without sacrificing security. Details are at hCaptcha.com/enterprise.Issuers in use are always expressed via the hcaptcha.com CAA record. If you would like to verify validity against a rogue issuer, please rely on this mechanism rather than manually pinning a particular certificate or locking to a single issuer.hCaptcha uses multiple certificates and issuers in parallel, and reserves the right to rotate between them or add more. hCaptcha infrastructure also uses short-lived certificates and rotates them frequently as part of our security best practices. This means that pinning a single certificate is not recommended.Different task types have different intrinsic difficulties associated with them. For example, picking the images that match a single simple criteria generally takes most people about the same amount of time. We use this in combination with the site difficulty level you select to decide what to show a user.Currently, we have 4 difficulty levels available in Publisher accounts (\"Always Challenge\" mode): Easy, Medium, Difficult, and Auto.Pro accounts also have access to our \"99.9% Passive\" No-CAPTCHA mode.Enterprise accounts have additional levels, including \"Passive\" and \"99.9% Passive\" No-CAPTCHA modes.Setting a different difficulty level influences the kinds of challenges your users will see. Setting the value to Auto means the user will always be presented with a challenge, with varying degrees of difficulty.hCaptcha provides a full accessibility solution that is usable by anyone able to browse the web. We believe hCaptcha as a service complies with WCAG and Section 508 requirements for publishers who need to meet these standards, but recommend publishers do their own evalation of their particular implementation.There are several different accommodation methods provided. Our universal accessibility approach avoids the limitations of audio challenges to serve users with auditory processing issues. We offer both an email-verification system and optional text-based challenges, available in over 100 languages. Every aspect of accessibility support is fully configurable by Enterprise customers, who also have the option of relying on a separate Passive (non-interactive) mode and consuming risk scores.Unlike competitors, we are not in the business of selling individually targeted ads. We work to protect your personal data and limit collection rather than selling it to others. Please see our Privacy Policy for more details.We care about privacy, and have been working on other solutions to this problem. Please see our Privacy Pass support if you would like to try out a cryptographically secure alternative to maintaining user privacy with hCaptcha. We are currently working within the IETF Privacy Pass working group to help this approach become a web standard, and expect it will be adopted by others in the future.hCaptcha Enterprise customers also have additional options to pre-blind all user data and create additional security guarantees that make HIPAA, PCI, and similar compliance very simple, as no personal data can ever reach hCaptcha at all.hCaptcha follows secure development lifecycle practices, runs an internal red team and Security Operations Center with dedicated staff, receives regular external penetration tests, and maintains a bug bounty program to encourage responsible disclosure by outside researchers.hCaptcha has also been externally audited to verify compliance with industry-standard security controls, including ISO 27001 certification and the SOC 2 Type II Security trust principle. A full SOC 2 Type II report is available to hCaptcha Enterprise customers upon request.It is very simple to switch to hCaptcha. Please see this guide on switching from reCAPTCHA to hCaptcha for more information. Most people only need to change three lines of code.To ensure you are in compliance with privacy laws coming into effect around the world, we recommend including the following:We also recommend integrating a notice into your Privacy Policy similar to the one directly below this answer.Note to sites with EU users:Navigating global privacy laws can be confusing, as the requirements differ depending on your jurisdiction and the jurisdiction of your users, so you should do your own analysis as to what is required based on your specific facts.For example: for users in the EU, this language is likely not required, as hCaptcha acts as a processor, and thus your site's terms and privacy policy apply, not ours. However, you should update your Privacy Policy to include a description of what data hCaptcha processes and under what basis, an in the sample text below.An alternate variant if you prefer to keep the same language globally would then be:(Linking to your own Privacy Policy in the final two words above.)Many parts of the world require disclosure of data processors. For reference, we have prepared the following text which hCaptcha customers are free to review in connection with their own transparency (privacy policy) obligations:hCaptchaWe use the hCaptcha security service (hereinafter \"hCaptcha\") on our website. This service is provided by Intuition Machines, Inc., a Delaware US Corporation (\"IMI\"). hCaptcha is used to check whether user actions on our online service (such as submitting a login or contact form) meet our security requirements. To do this, hCaptcha analyzes the behavior of the website or mobile app visitor based on various characteristics. This analysis starts automatically as soon as the website or mobile app visitor enters a part of the website or app with hCaptcha enabled. For the analysis, hCaptcha evaluates various information (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor has been on the website or app, or mouse movements made by the user).

Nous proposons un remplacement immédiat, cela ne prend donc souvent que quelques minutes.En général, les interactions côté client sont à peu près les mêmes qu'un captcha traditionnel : 3 à 10 secondes selon le mode de difficulté.Cela dépend de la confiance calculée dans l'humanité du visiteur, du niveau de difficulté du site et d'autres facteurs de sécurité. Lorsqu'un utilisateur échoue à un captcha, un nouveau lui sera également présenté.Le service hCaptcha fonctionne sur tous les principaux navigateurs de bureau et mobiles, ainsi que sur les applications de bureau et mobiles. Les deux dernières versions majeures de chaque navigateur sont officiellement prises en charge. Ce qui suit est une liste non exclusive de navigateurs entièrement pris en charge par hCaptcha :Internet Explorer 10 est actuellement pris en charge dans la mesure du possible. IE8 et IE9 ne sont plus pris en charge. Les versions de navigateur de meilleure qualité et non prises en charge représentent ensemble moins de 0,10 % de tout le trafic humain sur Internet en 2023.La fin de vie du support IE8 et IE9 Tier 1 (tests proactifs) a eu lieu le 1er janvier 2020. La fin de vie du support IE10 Tier 1 est survenue le 1er août 2020. Des extensions sont disponibles pour les utilisateurs d'entreprise. Veuillez nous contacter si vous avez besoin d'une assistance étendue.Seuls les navigateurs modernes sont pris en charge pour le tableau de bord d'administration hCaptcha, l'interface utilisée pour configurer hCaptcha pour votre site et consulter les statistiques. Les deux dernières versions majeures de chaque navigateur sont officiellement prises en charge :Les versions récentes d'Apple Safari devraient fonctionner, mais Firefox et Chrome sont les navigateurs recommandés.hCaptcha arrête également les robots et le spam, mais vous donne plus de contrôle sur le niveau de difficulté dont vous avez besoin pour votre site et protège mieux la confidentialité de vos utilisateurs.hCaptcha possède 100 % des fonctionnalités de reCAPTCHA V2 et est compatible API avec reCAPTCHA V2. Veuillez consulter nos documents de mise en œuvre pour plus d’informations.hCaptcha Enterprise possède toutes les fonctionnalités de reCAPTCHA V2 + V3 et va bien plus loin avec des modèles de menaces personnalisés sophistiqués, des scores de robots détaillés, etc., y compris une technologie de confidentialité unique qui facilite la conformité aux règles de confidentialité telles que RGPD, LGPD, CCPA, etc. sans sacrifier la sécurité. Les détails se trouvent sur hCaptcha.com/enterprise.Différents types de tâches sont associés à différentes difficultés intrinsèques. Par exemple, la sélection des images qui correspondent à un seul critère simple prend généralement à peu près le même temps à la plupart des gens. Nous utilisons cela en combinaison avec le niveau de difficulté du site que vous sélectionnez pour décider quoi montrer à un utilisateur.Actuellement, nous avons 4 niveaux de difficulté disponibles dans les comptes Editeur (mode \"Toujours Défi\") : Facile, Moyen, Difficile et Auto.Les comptes Pro ont également accès à notre mode « 99,9% Passif » sans CAPTCHA.Les comptes d'entreprise ont des niveaux supplémentaires, notamment les modes sans CAPTCHA « Passif » et « Passif à 99,9 % ».La définition d'un niveau de difficulté différent influence les types de défis que vos utilisateurs verront. Définir la valeur sur Auto signifie que l'utilisateur sera toujours confronté à un défi, avec différents degrés de difficulté.hCaptcha fournit une solution d'accessibilité complète utilisable par toute personne capable de naviguer sur le Web. Nous pensons que hCaptcha en tant que service est conforme aux exigences WCAG et de la section 508 pour les éditeurs qui doivent respecter ces normes, mais nous recommandons aux éditeurs de procéder à leur propre évaluation de leur mise en œuvre particulière.Il existe plusieurs méthodes d'hébergement différentes. Notre approche d'accessibilité universelle évite les limitations des défis audio pour servir les utilisateurs ayant des problèmes de traitement auditif. Nous proposons à la fois un système de vérification des e-mails et des défis optionnels basés sur du texte, disponibles dans plus de 100 langues. Chaque aspect de la prise en charge de l'accessibilité est entièrement configurable par les clients Entreprise, qui ont également la possibilité de s'appuyer sur un mode passif (non interactif) distinct et de consommer des scores de risque.Contrairement à nos concurrents, notre activité ne consiste pas à vendre des publicités ciblées individuellement.

Cependant, vous devez mettre à jour votre politique de confidentialité pour inclure une description des données traitées par hCaptcha et sur quelle base, dans l'exemple de texte ci-dessous.Une variante alternative si vous préférez conserver la même langue globalement serait alors :(Lien vers votre propre politique de confidentialité dans les deux derniers mots ci-dessus.)De nombreuses régions du monde exigent la divulgation des noms des sous-traitants. Pour référence, nous avons préparé le texte suivant que les clients hCaptcha sont libres de consulter dans le cadre de leurs propres obligations de transparence (politique de confidentialité) :hCaptchaNous utilisons le service de sécurité hCaptcha (ci-après « hCaptcha ») sur notre site Internet. Ce service est fourni par Intuition Machines, Inc., une société américaine du Delaware (« IMI »). hCaptcha est utilisé pour vérifier si les actions des utilisateurs sur notre service en ligne (telles que la soumission d'un formulaire de connexion ou de contact) répondent à nos exigences de sécurité. Pour ce faire, hCaptcha analyse le comportement du visiteur du site Web ou de l'application mobile en fonction de diverses caractéristiques. Cette analyse démarre automatiquement dès que le visiteur du site Web ou de l'application mobile entre dans une partie du site Web ou de l'application avec hCaptcha activé. Pour l'analyse, hCaptcha évalue diverses informations (par exemple l'adresse IP, la durée depuis laquelle le visiteur est sur le site Web ou l'application, ou les mouvements de souris effectués par l'utilisateur). Les données collectées lors de l'analyse seront transmises à l'IMI. L'analyse hCaptcha en \"mode invisible\" peut s'effectuer entièrement en arrière-plan. Les visiteurs du site Web ou de l’application ne sont pas informés qu’une telle analyse est en cours si aucun défi n’est présenté à l’utilisateur. Le traitement des données est basé sur l'art. 6, paragraphe 1, point b) du RGPD : le traitement des données personnelles est nécessaire à l'exécution d'un contrat auquel le visiteur du site Web est partie (par exemple, les conditions du site Web) ou à l'exécution de mesures à la demande du visiteur du site Web avant de conclure un contrat. Notre service en ligne (y compris notre site Web, nos applications mobiles et toute autre application ou autre forme d'accès que nous proposons) doit garantir qu'il interagit avec un humain, et non avec un robot, et que les activités effectuées par l'utilisateur ne sont pas liées à fraude ou abus. En outre, le traitement peut également être fondé sur l'art. 6(1)(f) du RGPD : notre service en ligne a un intérêt légitime à protéger le service contre l'exploration automatisée abusive, le spam et d'autres formes d'abus pouvant nuire à notre service ou à d'autres utilisateurs de notre service.\nIMI agit en tant que « sous-traitant » agissant pour le compte de ses clients tel que défini dans le RGPD, et en tant que « fournisseur de services » aux fins du California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

    "content": "Le widget hCaptcha peut protéger vos applications contre les robots, le spam et d'autres formes d'abus automatisés. L'installation de hCaptcha est rapide et facile. Cela nécessite soit l'ajout d'un simple code HTML et côté serveur, soit l'utilisation de l'un des nombreux outils prenant en charge nativement hCaptcha.Pour rendre l'intégration encore plus rapide, des wrappers et des plugins sont disponibles pour de nombreux frameworks : Angular, Node, Express, ReactJS, VueJS, WordPress et plus encore.Une liste complète des intégrations hCaptcha connues est également disponible.Si vous utilisez déjà le reCAPTCHA de Google, vous pouvez utiliser votre code existant avec quelques légères modifications. Les méthodes hCaptcha sont compatibles API avec les méthodes reCAPTCHA, par exemple render() et onload() . Les attributs de données personnalisés tels que theme , size et tab-index sont également pris en charge de la même manière par hCaptcha.Vous intégrez le widget hCaptcha sur votre site. Par exemple, sur un formulaire de connexion. L'utilisateur répond à un hCaptcha. Ils reçoivent un mot de passe de notre serveur qui est intégré à votre formulaire. Lorsque l'utilisateur clique sur Soumettre, le mot de passe est envoyé à votre serveur sous le formulaire. Votre serveur vérifie ensuite ce mot de passe avec l'API du serveur hCaptcha. hCaptcha dit qu'il est valide. Votre serveur sait désormais que l'utilisateur n'est pas un robot et lui permet de se connecter. Assez simple !Les en-têtes de stratégie de sécurité du contenu (CSP) constituent une couche de sécurité supplémentaire qui permet d'atténuer certains types d'attaques, notamment les attaques de type Cross Site Scripting (XSS), le détournement de clics et les attaques par injection de données.Si vous utilisez des en-têtes CSP, veuillez ajouter les éléments suivants à votre configuration :Veuillez ne pas coder en dur des sous-domaines spécifiques, comme newassets.hcaptcha.com , dans votre CSP : les sous-domaines d'actifs utilisés peuvent varier dans le temps ou selon la région.Si vous êtes un client entreprise et que vous souhaitez activer une vérification supplémentaire, vous pouvez éventuellement choisir la stratégie CSP suivante :hCaptcha nécessite deux petits morceaux de code côté client pour afficher un widget captcha sur une page HTML. Tout d'abord, vous devez inclure la ressource javascript hCaptcha quelque part dans votre page HTML. Le \u003cscript\u003e doit être chargé via HTTPS et peut être placé n'importe où sur la page. À l'intérieur de la balise \u003chead\u003e ou immédiatement après le conteneur .h-captcha, c'est tous les deux très bien.Deuxièmement, vous devez ajouter un conteneur DOM vide dans lequel le widget hCaptcha sera inséré automatiquement. Le conteneur est généralement un  (mais peut être n'importe quel élément) et doit avoir la classeh-captcha et un attributdata-sitekey défini sur la clé publique de votre site.En règle générale, vous souhaiterez inclure le conteneur .h-captcha vide dans un formulaire HTML. Lorsqu'un captcha est résolu avec succès, un jeton caché sera automatiquement ajouté à votre formulaire que vous pourrez ensuite POST sur votre serveur pour vérification. Vous pouvez le récupérer côté serveur avec le paramètre POST h-captcha-response .Voici un exemple complet où hCaptcha est utilisé pour protéger un formulaire d'inscription contre les abus automatisés. Lorsque le formulaire est soumis, le jetonh-captcha-response sera inclus avec les données POST de l'e-mail et du mot de passe une fois le captcha résolu.En ajoutant le code côté client, vous avez pu générer un widget hCaptcha qui identifiait si les utilisateurs étaient de vraies personnes ou des robots automatisés. Lorsque le captcha réussit, le script hCaptcha insère un jeton unique dans les données de votre formulaire.Pour vérifier que le jeton est bien réel et valide, vous devez maintenant le vérifier au niveau du point de terminaison de l'API :Le point de terminaison attend une requête POST avec deux paramètres : le secret de votre compte et le jetonh-captcha-response envoyé depuis votre HTML frontend vers votre backend pour vérification. Vous pouvez éventuellement inclure l'adresse IP de l'utilisateur comme contrôle de sécurité supplémentaire. N'envoyez pas de données JSON : le point de terminaison attend un formulaire POST codé en URL standard.Un test simple ressemblera à ceci :Notez que le point de terminaison attend le type de contenu application/x-www-form-urlencoded . Vous pouvez voir exactement ce qui est envoyé en utilisantdans l'exemple ci-dessus.N'utilisez pas de requête GET pour appeler /siteverify. Utilisez une requête POST et transmettez les paramètres dans le corps du formulaire, pas l'URL.Bien que le point de terminaison puisse répondre correctement à une requête GET ou à une requête POST utilisant des paramètres d'URL, cela n'est pas garanti. Si les paramètres que vous envoyez à GET sont trop longs, la requête échouera et vous ne pourrez pas valider les codes d'accès. L'utilisation d'une requête POST garantit que vous n'aurez pas ce problème.Veuillez noter que vous devez appeler /siteverify avec le secret de votre compte afin de valider que les codes d'accès que les utilisateurs vous envoient sont réels et non expirés. Vous ne pourrez pas non plus valider les codes d'accès d'une clé de site dans un compte si vous utilisez le secret d'un autre compte.Les jetons ne peuvent être utilisés qu’une seule fois et doivent être vérifiés dans un court laps de temps après leur émission. Pour récupérer le token sur votre serveur, utilisez le paramètre POSTh-captcha-response soumis par votre formulaire.Nous vous recommandons de transmettre le paramètre sitekey, car cela empêchera les jetons émis sur un sitekey d'être échangés ailleurs. En fonction de vos paramètres de difficulté, cela peut n'avoir aucun impact sur la sécurité, mais si vous définissez un niveau de difficulté plus élevé et n'appliquez pas les correspondances de clé de site, un adversaire pourrait potentiellement résoudre un défi plus facile sur une autre clé de site, puis l'échanger contre un défi plus difficile.Votre requête POST recevra une réponse JSON. Vous devez vérifier le champsuccess et n'exécuter votre logique métier normale que sisuccess esttrue . Sinon, vérifiez le champerror-codes pour un code d'erreur lisible par l'homme et renvoyez un message d'erreur approprié à l'utilisateur final.Voici à quoi ressemble une réponse JSON de hCaptcha :(Voir hCaptcha.com Enterprise pour plus de détails sur les fonctionnalités de hCaptcha Enterprise telles que les scores des robots, les modes « No-CAPTCHA » passifs et presque passifs, et plus encore.)Veuillez noter que le champ de crédit n'est pas toujours inclus et qu'il sera obsolète au troisième trimestre 2023.Veuillez également noter que le champ du nom d'hôte est dérivé du navigateur de l'utilisateur et ne doit pas être utilisé pour une authentification de quelque nature que ce soit ; il est principalement utile comme mesure statistique. De plus, dans le cas où votre site connaît un trafic de défi inhabituellement élevé, le champ du nom d'hôte peut être renvoyé comme « non fourni » plutôt que comme valeur habituelle ; tous les autres champs renverront leurs valeurs normales.Voici les codes d'erreur qui peuvent être renvoyés par l'API hCaptcha :Votre secret de vérification de site est uniquement destiné à l'authentification sécurisée de machine à machine ; cela ne devrait jamais être exposé publiquement.Si le secret de vérification de votre site a été involontairement exposé, vous pouvez recevoir un avertissement par e-mail de notre part.Vous pouvez également la faire pivoter vous-même à tout moment en visitant le tableau de bord, en choisissant l'icône de votre profil et l'option de menu Paramètres, puis en cliquant sur Obtenir une nouvelle clé secrète. Assurez-vous de copier cette valeur ! Nous ne le conservons pas, vous ne pourrez donc plus le revoir.Vous recevrez un e-mail de confirmation quelques secondes après la rotation.Remarque : Les utilisateurs Enterprise disposent d'options supplémentaires pour gérer les secrets par rapport aux utilisateurs Free et Pro.Par exemple, les comptes Enterprise peuvent créer plusieurs secrets Sitekey avec une expiration facultative et attribuer des secrets à une ou plusieurs clés de site pour permettre la segmentation des secrets par environnement, des clés uniques par équipe, etc. Veuillez consulter la documentation Enterprise pour plus de détails.Si vous développez sur votre machine locale, il y a quelques points à garder à l'esprit.Les navigateurs modernes ont des règles CORS et CORB strictes, donc ouvrir un file://URI qui charge hCaptcha ne fonctionnera pas. Le chargement de hCaptcha depuis http://localhost/ rencontrera le même problème sur certains navigateurs. L'API hCaptcha interdit également localhost et 127.0.0.1 comme noms d'hôte fournis.Le moyen le plus simple de contourner ces problèmes consiste à ajouter une entrée d’hôtes. Par exemple:Placez-le dans /etc/hosts sous Linux, /private/etc/hosts sous Mac OS X ouC:\\Windows\\System32\\Drivers\\etc\\hosts sous Windows.Vous pourrez ensuite accéder à votre serveur local via http://test.mydomain.com, et tout fonctionnera comme prévu.Vous pouvez installer nos types dactylographiés @hcaptcha/types pour la variable globalehcaptcha en utilisant votre gestionnaire de packages préféré :ououAjoutez une importation ou une référence à votre.d.ts :Ou ajoutez \"node_modules/@hcaptcha\" au typeRoots dans tsconfig.jsonSi vous avez l'intention d'exécuter des tests d'intégration automatisés qui accèdent à un serveur en direct, l'approche la plus simple consiste à utiliser les clés de site hCaptcha de test suivantes qui génèrent toujours un mot de passe sans poser de question. Ces mots de passe ne peuvent être vérifiés qu’à l’aide du secret de test.:::prudence\nLes clés de test n'offrent aucune protection anti-bot, veuillez donc vérifier que vous les utilisez uniquement dans votre environnement de test !\n:::Cette paire de clés ne contestera jamais et produira toujours le même jeton de réponse, qui renverra success: true lorsqu'il sera transmis au point de terminaison avec ce secret. La réponse siteverify contiendra les champs trouvés dans les comptes Publisher et Pro.Si vous êtes un client Enterprise, veuillez plutôt utiliser les paires de clés de test ci-dessous pour vous assurer que vous utilisez bien les champs score et d'autres champs Enterprise siteverify .Pour les utilisateurs de hCaptcha Enterprise, les deux paires de clés ci-dessus vous permettront de vérifier le comportement de votre application dans les scénarios de score les plus courants. Veuillez contacter vos ingénieurs de support d'intégration pour obtenir des conseils si vous avez des questions supplémentaires.Bravo! En suivant ce guide, vous disposez désormais d’une implémentation complète et fonctionnelle de hCaptcha. Par défaut, hCaptcha prend en charge plusieurs widgets par page et la localisation automatique.Si vous êtes intéressé par une implémentation plus avancée impliquant des rappels JavasSript, un rendu explicite, des thèmes alternatifs ou une localisation explicite, consultez la section suivante sur la configuration.Et si vous rencontrez des problèmes pour faire fonctionner hCaptcha sur votre site, ou si vous souhaitez lancer un pilote de notre service d'entreprise pour essayer les scores des robots, les modes sans CAPTCHA, et bien plus encore, [prenez contact](mailto:support @hcaptcha.com) et nous serons heureux de vous aider."

    "title": "Developer Guide | hCaptcha",
    "links": null,
    "content": "The hCaptcha widget can protect your applications from bots, spam, and other forms of automated abuse. Installing hCaptcha is fast and easy. It requires either adding some simple HTML and server side code, or using one of the many tools that natively support hCaptcha.To make integration even quicker, wrappers and plugins are available for many frameworks: Angular, Node, Express, ReactJS, VueJS, WordPress and more.A complete list of known hCaptcha integrations is also available.If you're already using Google's reCAPTCHA, you can use your existing code with a few slight changes. hCaptcha methods are API-compatible with reCAPTCHA methods, for example render() and onload(). Custom data attributes like theme, size, and tab-index are also supported in the same way by hCaptcha.You embed the hCaptcha widget on your site. For example, on a login form. The user answers an hCaptcha. They get a passcode from our server that is embedded in your form. When the user clicks Submit the passcode is sent to your server in the form. Your server then checks that passcode with the hCaptcha server API. hCaptcha says it is valid. Your server now knows the user is not a bot and lets them log in. Pretty simple!Content Security Policy (CSP) headers are an added layer of security that help to mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and data injection attacks.If you use CSP headers, please add the following to your configuration:Please do not hard-code specific subdomains, like newassets.hcaptcha.com, into your CSP: asset subdomains used may vary over time or by region.If you are an enterprise customer and would like to enable additional verification to be performed, you can optionally choose the following CSP strategy:hCaptcha requires two small pieces of client side code to render a widget on an HTML page. First, you must include the hCaptcha javascript resource somewhere in your HTML page. The \u003cscript\u003e must be loaded via HTTPS and can be placed anywhere on the page. Inside the \u003chead\u003e tag or immediately after the .h-captcha container are both fine.Second, you must add an empty DOM container where the hCaptcha widget will be inserted automatically. The container is typically a \u003cdiv\u003e (but can be any element) and must have class h-captcha and a data-sitekey attribute set to your public sitekey.The sitekey is our unique identifier for your site, app, or flow.You can set behavior and track statistics per-sitekey. This lets you choose the granularity you need, whether that is a single sitekey used across many sites or one sitekey per flow, e.g. one for signup and one for login.Typically, you'll want to include the empty .h-captcha container inside an HTML form. When a challenge is successfully passed, a hidden token will automatically be added to your form that you can then POST to your server for verification. You can retrieve it server side with POST parameter h-captcha-response.Here's a full example where hCaptcha is being used to protect a signup form from automated abuse. When the form is submitted, the h-captcha-response token will be included with the email and password POST data after the challenge is passed.By adding the client side code, you were able to render an hCaptcha widget that identified if users were real people or automated bots. When the challenge succeeded, the hCaptcha script inserted a unique token into your form data.To verify that the token is indeed real and valid, you must now verify it at the API endpoint:The endpoint expects a POST request with two parameters: your account secret and the h-captcha-response token sent from your frontend HTML to your backend for verification. You can optionally include the user's IP address as an additional security check. Do not send JSON data: the endpoint expects a standard URL-encoded form POST.A simple test will look like this:The endpoint expects the application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Type. You can see exactly what is sent usingin the example above.Do not use a GET request to call /siteverify. Use a POST request, and pass the parameters in the form body, not the URL.While the endpoint may respond correctly to a GET request or to a POST request that uses URL parameters, this is not guaranteed. If the parameters you send to GET are too long, the request will fail and you will be unable to validate passcodes. Using a POST request ensures you will not have this problem.Please note that you must call /siteverify with your account secret in order to validate passcodes users send you are real and unexpired. You will also be unable to validate passcodes from a sitekey in one account if using a different account's secret.Tokens can only be used once and must be verified within a short period of time after being issued. To retrieve the token on your server, use the h-captcha-response POST parameter submitted by your form.We recommend passing the sitekey parameter, as it will prevent tokens issued on one sitekey from being redeemed elsewhere. Depending on your difficulty settings this might have no security impact, but if you set a higher difficulty level and do not enforce sitekey matches an adversary could potentially solve an easier challenge on another sitekey, then redeem it on a harder one.Your POST request will receive a JSON response. You should check the success field and only execute your normal business logic if success is true. Otherwise, check the error-codes field for a human-readable error code and return an appropriate error message to the end user, or a generic error message if no details are specified in error-codes.Here's what a JSON response from hCaptcha looks like:(See hCaptcha.com/enterprise for details on hCaptcha Enterprise features like bot scores, passive and nearly passive \"No-CAPTCHA\" modes, and more.)Please note that the credit field is not always included, and is scheduled for deprecation in Q3 2023.Please also note that the hostname field is derived from the user's browser, and should not be used for authentication of any kind; it is primarily useful as a statistical metric. Additionally, in the event that your site experiences unusually high challenge traffic, the hostname field may be returned as \"not-provided\" rather than the usual value; all other fields will return their normal values.These are the error codes that can be returned by the hCaptcha API:Your siteverify secret is solely for secure machine-to-machine authentication; it should never be exposed publicly.If your siteverify secret has been unintentionally exposed, you may receive an email warning from us.You can also rotate it yourself at any time by visiting the Dashboard, choosing your profile icon and Settings menu option, and then clicking Generate New Secret. Make sure to copy that value! We don't retain it, so you won't be able to see it again.You will receive an email confirmation within a few seconds of rotation.Note: Free users may rotate the secret once per day. Pro users may rotate secrets up to 3 times per day. Enterprise users have additional options to manage secrets.For example, Enterprise accounts can create multiple Sitekey Secrets with an optional expiry and assign secrets to one or many sitekeys to enable segmentation of secrets by environment, unique keys per team, and more. Please see the Enterprise docs for more details.If you are developing on your local machine there are a few things to keep in mind.Modern browsers have strict CORS and CORB rules, so opening a file://URI that loads hCaptcha will not work. Loading hCaptcha from http://localhost/ will encounter the same issue on some browsers. The hCaptcha API also prohibits localhost and 127.0.0.1 as supplied hostnames.The simplest way to circumvent these issues is to add a hosts entry. For example:Place this in /etc/hosts on Linux, /private/etc/hosts on Mac OS X, or C:\\Windows\\System32\\Drivers\\etc\\hosts on Windows.You can then access your local server via http://test.mydomain.com, and everything will work as expected.You can install our typescript types @hcaptcha/types for the hcaptcha global variable using your preferred package manager:ororAdd import or reference to your .d.ts:Or add \"node_modules/@hcaptcha\" to the typeRoots in tsconfig.jsonIf you intend to run automated integration tests that access a live server, the simplest approach is to use the following test hCaptcha sitekeys that always generate a passcode without asking a question. Those passcodes can only be verified using the test secret.The test keys provide no anti-bot protection, so please double-check that you use them only in your test environment!This keypair will never challenge and always produce the same response token, which will return success: true when passed to the endpoint with this secret. The siteverify response will have the fields found in Publisher and Pro accounts.If you are an Enterprise customer, please instead use the test keypairs below to ensure you are consuming score and other Enterprise siteverify fields.For hCaptcha Enterprise users, the two keypairs above will allow you to verify your application behavior in the most common score scenarios. Please contact your integration support engineers for guidance if you have additional questions.Congrats! By following this guide, you now have a complete and working implementation of hCaptcha. By default, hCaptcha supports multiple widgets per page and automatic localization.If you're interested in a more advanced implementation that involves JavasSript callbacks, explicit rendering, alternative themes, or explicit localization, check out the next section on configuration.And if you have any issues getting hCaptcha to work on your site, or you'd like to start a pilot of our enterprise service to try out bot scores, No-CAPTCHA modes, and more, get in touch and we'll be happy to help."
